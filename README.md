# Weather App using Public API data

I created this app in order to learn more about how APIs work and how to send and receive data from them.


## Roadmap

- Acquired data regarding City Coordinates [✓] - https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities

- CSV Data Parsing using Papa Parse v5.0 [✓]

- Retrieval of Longitude and Latitude from CSV using a city name [✓]

- API call and data retrieval for relevant information [✓] - https://open-meteo.com/en/docs

- ~~Storing CSV in a Database to access it remotely [For the future]~~

- Found another API to use instead of the csv i was previously using in order to search for the city's coordinates. [✓] - https://open-meteo.com/en/docs/geocoding-api

- Improving UI & UX [For the future]

- Statistics based on API data[TBD]
